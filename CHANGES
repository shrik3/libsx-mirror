Early versions of libsx have been released around 1993 by Dominic Giampaolo
(dbg@sgi.com), using also code provided by Allen Martin (amartin@wpi.wpi.edu).

The present release includes an html documentation produced by
Stephen Chenney (stephen@cs.su.oz.au) and Winston Holmes 
(winston@nestor.engr.utk.edu), and some useful additional routines 
(pixmap buttons, file selector, color selector, internationalization). 

Libsx-2.08 should be mostly API compatible with earlier versions -- at least 
as much as libsx-1.1 was with libsx-1.0. These modifications have been
made step by step over a period of 20 years 1998-2017 ...

The first widely announced public release of version 2 was 2.03. 
Version 2.0x, especially, include an internationalization routine. 
To produce dialogs for a new language, it is only needed to translate 
the (20 lines) file  src/dialogs/dialogs.XX where XX is the country code.

Many thanks to Walter Harms for contributing docs in the form of man pages,
and for pointing out a few inaccuracies (this was around 2004).

A text edit widget is an area used to display and optionally edit
multiple lines of text.  You can specify the text to be displayed as
either an in memory string or as a file name.  The text edit area
manages its scrollbars and internal affairs, you need not do anything
(in fact there are no callbacks for the text edit widget).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Widget  MakeTextWidget(char *txt, int is_file, int editable, int w, int h);

This functions lets you create a text edit widget that will display
some text and optionally let the user edit and manipulate it.  The
first argument, txt, is a pointer to a string (NULL is ok). The second
argument, is_file, is a boolean value indicating if the first argument
should be interpreted as a file name or not.  The next argument,
editable, is a boolean value indicating whether or not the user is
allowed to edit the text.  The final two arguments specify the width
and height of the drawing area box.  If the area is too small to
display the text, scrollbars will appear.

The txt argument can either contain the entire string (null
terminated) that you would like the user to edit, or it can contain
the name of a file to be loaded into the text edit widget.  If the
second argument is_file is TRUE (1), then the first argument gets
interpreted as a file name.  If is_file is FALSE (0), then the first
argument contains the actual text to be displayed.

If the txt argument contains the actual text to be displayed, after
calling MakeTextWidget() you can free the memory if necessary (the
text edit widget makes an internal copy of the string).

The argument `editable' is a boolean value indicating whether or not
to allow editing of the text in the widget.  If you just wish to
display some text (such as a help file), set the editable argument to
FALSE (0) and the user will not be allowed to modify the text.

void    SetTextWidgetText(Widget w, char *text, int is_file);

This argument lets you modify the text displayed in a text edit
widget.  The first argument identifies the text edit widget to change.
The second argument is a null-terminated string that either contains
the actual text to display or the name of a file to read in.  If the
is_file argument is TRUE (1), then the string pointed to by the
argument, text, is interpreted as a file name.  If is_file is FALSE,
the string pointed to by text is directly displayed in the text edit
widget. 

After calling this function, you can free the string pointed to by
text if necessary.  The text edit widget makes an internal copy of the
text.  If you wish to update the displayed text again, you should call
SetTextWidgetText() again.

BUGS: The function name is way too long.

char   *GetTextWidgetText(Widget w);

This function lets you retrieve the text contained in a text edit
widget.  The only argument, w, should be a text edit widget created
with MakeTextWidget().

The return from this function is a character pointer to a
null-terminated string that contains the current text in the widget.
If there is an error, a NULL is returned.

NOTE: You should not free or otherwise modify the text returned by
      this function.  If you need to make modifications, make a copy
      of the buffer.  Again, DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT RETURNED BY THIS
      FUNCTION.  Make a copy if you need to modify it.

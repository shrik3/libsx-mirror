A label widget is a widget that displays some text or bitmap but cannot 
be clicked on or interacted with by the user.  In addition to "simple"
label widgets, other widgets such as buttons or menus can as well 
carry labels. Generally a label is for informational purposes, such as 
saying what the program title is, or what the widget is supposed to be
used for. Some widgets carry predefined labels; the list of predefined 
labels is:

char *SX_Dialog_Label[] = {"Yes", "Cancel", "No", "Okay", "Cancel", "Retry" };

The pointers to these labels can be reassigned to other string pointers, so 
as (e.g.) to provide translations into other languages.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Widget MakeLabel(char *txt);

This function creates a label that contains the text in the character
string pointed to by "txt".  The text will simply be displayed, with
no fancy borders or special highlighting.  If the text contains new
line characters, they will be interpreted properly.

If the argument txt is NULL, then no label will be set for the widget.
This is convienent if you plan to put a bitmap on this widget with the
SetWidgetBitmap() function.

This widget is useful for displaying a piece of textual information
like a filename or user name.

If this routine fails, a NULL is returned.
